\begin{frame}{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ``Experimental Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Generation''\autocite{huang2021}
    \item Implemented quantum GANs on a real quantum device. 
    
    \item The authors train and use a patch GAN on a superconducting quantum processor to generate the images you saw on the title slide.

\item Two training strategies: \begin{itemize}
    \item Batch: Training the GAN on batches of images
    \item Patch: Dividing the image into smaller patches and training the GAN on each patch individually
\end{itemize}
