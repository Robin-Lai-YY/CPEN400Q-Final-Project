\begin{frame}{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
    \item "Experimental Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Generation"
    \item Implemented quantum GANs on a real quantum device. 
    
    \item They achieve the learning and generating of real-world 
    \hspace{0.4cm} handwritten 2X2 digit images on a superconducting \hspace{0.4cm} quantum processor.

\item Two training strategies: 

    Batch: Training the GAN on batches of images
    
    Patch: Dividing the image into smaller patches and training 
    
    \hspace{1.1cm} the GAN on each patch individually
